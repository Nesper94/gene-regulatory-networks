"Pattern formation is a central problem in development
(Wolpert, 1969)"

"Central problems are how positional information is set up, how it is
recorded, and then how it is interpreted by the cells".

"The function of a positional gradient is to specify position and how this is
recorded and appropriate genes turned on and off is a central problem. Ashe
and Briscoe (2006) reviewed how morphogens act as graded positional
cues and raises several mechanistic issues, such as how responding cells per-
ceive and interpret the concentration-dependent information to generate
precise patterns of gene expression and cell differentiation in developing tis-
sues."

«Cohen, Briscoe, and Blassberg (2013) argue, that is, that cell iden-
tity results from the combined input of Shh signaling, uniformly expressed
neural factors, and the cross-regulatory network of downstream Shh target
genes. They provide evidence that “Shh morphogen interpretation in the
neural tube is an emergent property of its downstream gene regulatory
network. Cells transform the extracellular gradient of Shh into a dynamic
profile of intracellular Gli activity that engages a transcriptional circuit,
the regulatory logic of which is responsible for the generation of the char-
acteristic temporal and spatial patterns of gene expression. This mechanism
offers a powerful strategy to achieve the characteristic precision and robust-
ness of morphogen-mediated pattern formation.”»
