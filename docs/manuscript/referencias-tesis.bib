abstract = {Networks of interacting biomolecules carry out many essential functions in living cells, but the 'design principles' underlying the functioning of such intracellular networks remain poorly understood, despite intensive efforts including quantitative analysis of relatively simple systems. Here we present a complementary approach to this problem: the design and construction of a synthetic network to implement a particular function. We used three transcriptional repressor systems that are not part of any natural biological clock to build an oscillating network, termed the repressilator, in Escherichia coli. The network periodically induces the synthesis of green fluorescent protein as a readout of its state in individual cells. The resulting oscillations, with typical periods of hours, are slower than the cell-division cycle, so the state of the oscillator has to be transmitted from generation to generation. This artificial clock displays noisy behaviour, possibly because of stochastic fluctuations of its components. Such 'rational network design may lead both to the engineering of new cellular behaviours and to an improved understanding of naturally occurring networks.},

abstract = {Detailed understanding and control of biological networks will require a level of description similar to that of electronic engineering blueprints. Currently, however, even the best-studied systems are usually described using qualitative arrow diagrams. A quantitative blueprint requires in vivo measurements of (1) the relative strength of the interactions (numbers on the arrows) and (2) the functions that integrate multiple inputs. Here, we address this using a well-studied system, the flagella biosynthesis transcription network in Escherichia coli. We use theory and high-resolution experiments to obtain a quantitative blueprint with (1) numbers on the arrows, finding different hierarchies of activation coefficients for the two regulators, FlhDC and FliA; and (2) cis-regulatory input functions, which summate the input from the two regulators (SUM gates). We then demonstrate experimentally how this blueprint can be used to reprogram temporal expression patterns in this system, using controlled expression of the regulators or point mutations in their binding sites. The present approach can be used to define blueprints of other gene networks and to quantitatively reprogram their dynamics.},

abstract = {Signaling pathways are interconnected to regulatory circuits for sensing the environment and expressing the appropriate genetic profile. In particular, gradients of diffusing molecules (morphogens) determine cell fate at a given position, dictating development and spatial organization. The feedforward loop (FFL) circuit is among the simplest genetic architectures able to generate one-stripe patterns by operating as an amplitude detection device, where high output levels are achieved at intermediate input ones. Here, using a heuristic optimization-based approach, we dissected the design space containing all possible topologies and parameter values of the FFL circuits. We explored the ability of being sensitive or adaptive to variations in the critical morphogen level where cell fate is switched. We found four different solutions for precision, corresponding to the four incoherent architectures, but remarkably only one mode for adaptiveness, the incoherent type 4 (I4-FFL). We further carried out a theoretical study to unveil the design principle for such structural discrimination, finding that the synergistic action and cooperative binding on the downstream promoter are instrumental to achieve absolute adaptive responses. Subsequently, we analyzed the robustness of these optimal circuits against perturbations in the kinetic parameters and molecular noise, which has allowed us to depict a scenario where adaptiveness, parameter sensitivity and noise tolerance are different, correlated facets of the robustness of the I4-FFL circuit. Strikingly, we showed a strong correlation between the input (environment-related) and the intrinsic (mutation-related) susceptibilities. Finally, we discussed the evolution of incoherent regulations in terms of multifunctionality and robustness. {\textcopyright} 2011 Rodrigo, Elena.},

Morphogens are signaling molecules that emanate from a restricted region of a tissue and spread away from their source to form a concentration gradient. As the fate of each cell in the field depends on the concentration of the morphogen signal, the gradient prefigures the pattern of development.

@article{Wolpert1969,
abstract = {The problem of pattern is considered in terms of how genetic information can be translated in a reliable manner to give specific and different spatial patterns of cellular differentiation. Pattern formation thus differs from molecular differentiation which is mainly concerned with the control of synthesis of specific macromolecules within cells rather than the spatial arrangement of the cells. It is suggested that there may be a universal mechanism whereby the translation of genetic information into spatial patterns of differentiation is achieved. The basis of this is a mechanism whereby the cells in a developing system may have their position specified with respect to one or more points in the system. This specification of position is positional information. Cells which have their positional information specified with respect to the same set of points constitute a field. Positional information largely determines with respect to the cells' genome and developmental history the nature of its molecular differentiation. The specification of positional information in general precedes and is independent of molecular differentiation. The concept of positional information implies a co-ordinate system and polarity is defined as the direction in which positional information is specified or measured. Rules for the specification of positional information and polarity are discussed. Pattern regulation, which is the ability of the system to form the pattern even when parts are removed, or added, and to show size invariance as in the French Flag problem, is largely dependent on the ability of the cells to change their positional information and interpret this change. These concepts are applied in some detail to early sea urchin development, hydroid regeneration, pattern formation in the insect epidermis, and the development of the chick limb. It is concluded that these concepts provide a unifying framework within which a wide variety of patterns formed from fields may be discussed, and give new meaning to classical concepts such as induction, dominance and field. The concepts direct attention towards finding mechanisms whereby position and polarity are specified, and the nature of reference points and boundaries. More specifically, it is suggested that the mechanism is required to specify the position of about 50 cells in a line, relatively reliably, in about 10 hours. The size of embryonic fields is, surprisingly, usually less than 50 cells in any direction. {\textcopyright} 1969 Academic Press Inc. (London) Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Tissue patterning during animal development is orchestrated by a handful of inductive signals. Most of these developmental cues act as morphogens, meaning they are locally produced secreted molecules that act at a distance to govern tissue patterning. The iterative use of the same signaling molecules in different developmental contexts demands that signal interpretation occurs in a highly context-dependent manner. Hence the interpretation of signal depends on the specific competence of the receiving cells. Moreover, it has become clear that the differential interpretation of morphogens depends not only on the level of signaling but also the signaling dynamics, particularly the duration of signaling. In this review, we outline molecular mechanisms proposed in recent studies that explain how the response to morphogens is determined by differential competence, pathway intrinsic feedback, and the interpretation of signaling dynamics by gene regulatory networks.

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 21-23 nucleotide RNA molecules that regulate the stability or translational efficiency of target messenger RNAs. miRNAs have diverse functions, including the regulation of cellular differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. Although strict tissue- and developmental-stage-specific expression is critical for appropriate miRNA function, mammalian transcription factors that regulate miRNAs have not yet been identified. The proto-oncogene c-MYC encodes a transcription factor that regulates cell proliferation, growth and apoptosis. Dysregulated expression or function of c-Myc is one of the most common abnormalities in human malignancy. Here we show that c-Myc activates expression of a cluster of six miRNAs on human chromosome 13. Chromatin immunoprecipation experiments show that c-Myc binds directly to this locus. The transcription factor E2F1 is an additional target of c-Myc that promotes cell cycle progression. We find that expression of E2F1 is negatively regulated by two miRNAs in this cluster, miR-17-5p and miR-20a. These findings expand the known classes of transcripts within the c-Myc target gene network, and reveal a mechanism through which c-Myc simultaneously activates E2F1 transcription and limits its translation, allowing a tightly controlled proliferative signal.},

However, the number of different mechanisms that may exist for cells to interpret morphogens, and the importance of design features such as feedback or local cell-cell communication, is unclear. A complete understanding of such systems will require going beyond a case-by-case analysis of real morphogen interpretation mechanisms and mapping out a complete GRN 'design space.' Here, we generate a first atlas of design space for GRNs capable of patterning a homogeneous field of cells into discrete gene expression domains by interpreting a fixed morphogen gradient. We uncover multiple very distinct mechanisms distributed discretely across the atlas, thereby expanding the repertoire of morphogen interpretation network motifs. Analyzing this diverse collection of mechanisms also allows us to predict that local cell-cell communication will rarely be responsible for the basic dose-dependent response of morphogen interpretation networks.},

abstract = {Complex gene-regulation networks are made of simple recurring gene circuits called network motifs. The functions of several network motifs have recently been studied experimentally, including the coherent feed-forward loop (FFL) with an AND input function that acts as a sign-sensitive delay element. Here, we study the function of the coherent FFL with a sum input function (SUM-FFL). We analyze the dynamics of this motif by means of high-resolution expression measurements in the flagella gene-regulation network, the system that allows Escherichia coli to swim. In this system, the master regulator FlhDC activates a second regulator, FliA, and both activate in an additive fashion the operons that produce the flagella motor. We find that this motif prolongs flagella expression following deactivation of the master regulator, protecting flagella production from transient loss of input signal. Thus, in contrast to the AND-FFL that shows a delay following signal activation, the SUM-FFL shows delays after signal deactivation. The SUM-FFL in this system works as theoretically predicted despite being embedded in at least two additional feedback loops. The present function might be carried out by the SUM-FFL in systems found across organisms. },

The gap gene system constitutes the most upstream zygotic layer of this regulatory hierarchy, responsible for the initial interpretation of positional information encoded by maternal gradients. We present a detailed analysis of regulatory interactions involved in gap gene regulation based on gap gene circuits, which are mathematical gene network models used to infer regulatory interactions from quantitative gene expression data. Our models reproduce gap gene expression at high accuracy and temporal resolution. Regulatory interactions found in gap gene circuits provide consistent and sufficient mechanisms for gap gene expression, which largely agree with mechanisms previously inferred from qualitative studies of mutant gene expression patterns. Our models predict activation of Kr by Cad and clarify several other regulatory interactions. Our analysis suggests a central role for repressive feedback loops between complementary gap genes. We observe that repressive interactions among overlapping gap genes show anteroposterior asymmetry with posterior dominance. Finally, our models suggest a correlation between timing of gap domain boundary formation and regulatory contributions from the terminal maternal system.},

A common analysis approach is combining experimental and theoretical strategies, thereby fostering relevant data on the dynamics and transduction of gradients. The mechanisms of morphogen transport and conversion from graded information to binary responses are some of the topics on which these combined strategies have shed light. Herein, we review these data, emphasizing, on the one hand, how theoretical approaches have been helpful and, on the other hand, how these have been combined with experimental strategies. In addition, we discuss those cases in which gradient formation and gradient interpretation at the molecular and/or cellular level may influence each other within a mutual feedback loop.

abstract = {VEGFA signaling controls physiological and pathological angiogenesis and hematopoiesis. Although many context-dependent signaling pathways downstream of VEGFA have been uncovered, vegfa transcriptional regulation in vivo remains unclear. Here, we show that the ETS transcription factor, Etv6, positively regulates vegfa expression during Xenopus blood stem cell development through multiple transcriptional inputs. In agreement with its established repressive functions, Etv6 directly inhibits expression of the repressor foxo3, to prevent Foxo3 from binding to and repressing the vegfa promoter. Etv6 also directly activates expression of the activator klf4; reflecting a genome-wide paucity in ETS-binding motifs in Etv6 genomic targets, Klf4 then recruits Etv6 to the vegfa promoter to activate its expression. These two mechanisms (double negative gate and feed-forward loop) are classic features of gene regulatory networks specifying cell fates. Thus, Etv6's dual function, as a transcriptional repressor and activator, controls a major signaling pathway involved in endothelial and blood development in vivo.},

abstract = {Phenotypic variation is the raw material of adaptive Darwinian evolution. The phenotypic variation found in organismal development is biased towards certain phenotypes, but the molecular mechanisms behind such biases are still poorly understood. Gene regulatory networks have been proposed as one cause of constrained phenotypic variation. However, most pertinent evidence is theoretical rather than experimental. Here, we study evolutionary biases in two synthetic gene regulatory circuits expressed in Escherichia coli that produce a gene expression stripe-a pivotal pattern in embryonic development. The two parental circuits produce the same phenotype, but create it through different regulatory mechanisms. We show that mutations cause distinct novel phenotypes in the two networks and use a combination of experimental measurements, mathematical modelling and DNA sequencing to understand why mutations bring forth only some but not other novel gene expression phenotypes. Our results reveal that the regulatory mechanisms of networks restrict the possible phenotypic variation upon mutation. Consequently, seemingly equivalent networks can indeed be distinct in how they constrain the outcome of further evolution.},

The package allows colouring and annotation of a tree by numerical/categorical node attributes, manipulating a tree by rotating, collapsing and zooming out clades, highlighting user selected clades or operational taxonomic units and exploration of a large tree by zooming into a selected portion. A two-dimensional tree can be drawn by scaling the tree width based on an attribute of the nodes.

One of such motifs found in Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Drosophila melanogaster is the feed-forward loop, in which an effector regulates its target by a direct regulatory interaction and an indirect interaction mediated by another gene product. Here, we theoretically analyze the behavior of networks that contain feed-forward loops cross talking to each other. In response to levels of the effecter, such networks can generate multiple rise-and-fall temporal expression profiles and spatial stripes, which are typically observed in developmental processes. The mechanism to generate these responses reveals the way of inferring the regulatory pathways from experimental results. Our database study of gene regulatory networks indicates that most feed-forward loops actually cross talk. We discuss how the feed-forward loops and their cross talks can play important roles in morphogenesis.},

abstract = {Simulations of evolution have a long history, but their relation to biology is questioned because of the perceived contingency of evolution. Here we provide an example of a biological process, adaptation, where simulations are argued to approach closer to biology. Adaptation is a common feature of sensory systems, and a plausible component of other biochemical networks because it rescales upstream signals to facilitate downstream processing. We create random gene networks numerically, by linking genes with interactions that model transcription, phosphorylation and protein-protein association. We define a fitness function for adaptation in terms of two functional metrics, and show that any reasonable combination of them will yield the same adaptive networks after repeated rounds of mutation and selection. Convergence to these networks is driven by positive selection and thus fast. There is always a path in parameter space of continuously improving fitness that leads to perfect adaptation, implying that the actual mutation rates we use in the simulation do not bias the results. Our results imply a kinetic view of evolution, i.e., it favors gene networks that can be learned quickly from the random examples supplied by mutation. This formulation allows for deductive predictions of the networks realized in nature.},

abstract = {How morphogen gradients govern the pattern of gene expression in developing tissues is not well understood. Here, we describe a statistical thermodynamic model of gene regulation that combines the activity of a morphogen with the transcriptional network it controls. Using Sonic hedgehog (Shh) patterning of the ventral neural tube as an example, we show that the framework can be used together with the principled parameter selection technique of approximate Bayesian computation to obtain a dynamical model that accurately predicts tissue patterning. The analysis indicates that, for each target gene regulated by Gli, which is the transcriptional effector of Shh signalling, there is a neutral point in the gradient, either side of which altering the Gli binding affinity has opposite effects on gene expression. This explains recent counterintuitive experimental observations. The approach is broadly applicable and provides a unifying framework to explain the temporospatial pattern of morphogen-regulated gene expression.},

abstract = {Recent analysis of the structure of transcription regulation networks revealed several "network motifs": regulatory circuit patterns that occur much more frequently than in randomized networks. It is important to understand whether these network motifs have specific functions. One of the most significant network motifs is the coherent feedforward loop, in which transcription factor X regulates transcription factor Y, and both jointly regulate gene Z. On the basis of mathematical modeling and simulations, it was suggested that the coherent feedforward loop could serve as a sign-sensitive delay element: a circuit that responds rapidly to step-like stimuli in one direction (e.g. ON to OFF), and at a delay to steps in the opposite direction (OFF to ON). Is this function actually carried out by feedforward loops in living cells? Here, we address this experimentally, using a system with feedforward loop connectivity, the L-arabinose utilization system of Escherichiacoli. We measured responses to step-like cAMP stimuli at high temporal resolution and accuracy by means of green fluorescent protein reporters. We show that the arabinose system displays sign-sensitive delay kinetics. This type of kinetics is important for making decisions based on noisy inputs by filtering out fluctuations in input stimuli, yet allowing rapid response. This information-processing function may be performed by the feedforward loop regulation modules that are found in diverse systems from bacteria to humans. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Rogers2011,
abstract = {Morphogens are long-range signaling molecules that pattern developing tissues in a concentration-dependent manner. The graded activity of morphogens within tissues exposes cells to different signal levels and leads to region-specific transcriptional responses and cell fates. In its simplest incarnation, a morphogen signal forms a gradient by diffusion from a local source and clearance in surrounding tissues. Responding cells often transduce morphogen levels in a linear fashion, which results in the graded activation of transcriptional effectors. The concentration-dependent expression of morphogen target genes is achieved by their different binding affinities for transcriptional effectors as well as inputs from other transcriptional regulators. Morphogen distribution and interpretation are the result of complex interactions between the morphogen and responding tissues. The response to a morphogen is dependent not simply on morphogen concentration but also on the duration of morphogen exposure and the state of the target cells. In this review, we describe the morphogen concept and discuss the mechanisms that underlie the generation, modulation, and interpretation of morphogen gradients.},

The classical methods of ligation, puncture, transplantation, destruction or removal of material, and centrifugation were applied to eggs of a variety of insect species. Although the degree of response to experimental manipulation was found to be widely different, there were similarities in the type of abnormal patterns produced by the various treatments which suggested more general conclusions:- the anteroposterior pattern is probably controlled by two centres of activity, localized at the anterior and posterior egg pole respectively, with a long-range effect on the entire egg axis (reviewed by Sander, 1976).},

abstract = {Pattern formation is a hallmark of coordinated cell behaviour in both single and multicellular organisms. It typically involves cell-cell communication and intracellular signal processing. Here we show a synthetic multicellular system in which genetically engineered 'receiver' cells are programmed to form ring-like patterns of differentiation based on chemical gradients of an acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) signal that is synthesized by 'sender' cells. In receiver cells, 'band-detect' gene networks respond to user-defined ranges of AHL concentrations. By fusing different fluorescent proteins as outputs of network variants, an initially undifferentiated 'lawn' of receivers is engineered to form a bullseye pattern around a sender colony. Other patterns, such as ellipses and clovers, are achieved by placing senders in different configurations. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal which kinetic parameters most significantly affect ring development over time. Construction and study of such synthetic multicellular systems can improve our quantitative understanding of naturally occurring developmental processes and may foster applications in tissue engineering, biomaterial fabrication and biosensing.},

abstract = {Many complex systems display a surprising degree of tolerance against errors. For example, relatively simple organisms grow, persist and reproduce despite drastic pharmaceutical or environmental interventions, an error tolerance attributed to the robustness of the underlying metabolic network1. Complex communication networks2 display a surprising degree of robustness: although key components regularly malfunction, local failures rarely lead to the loss of the global information-carrying ability of the network. The stability of these and other complex systems is often attributed to the redundant wiring of the functional web defined by the systems' components. Here we demonstrate that error tolerance is not shared by all redundant systems: it is displayed only by a class of inhomogeneously wired networks, called scale-free networks, which include the World-Wide Web3,4,5, the Internet6, social networks7 and cells8. We find that such networks display an unexpected degree of robustness, the ability of their nodes to communicate being unaffected even by unrealistically high failure rates. However, error tolerance comes at a high price in that these networks are extremely vulnerable to attacks (that is, to the selection and removal of a few nodes that play a vital role in maintaining the network's connectivity). Such error tolerance and attack vulnerability are generic properties of communication networks.},

Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon (popularly known as six degrees of separation. The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks.

abstract = {Several fundamental concepts of developmental biology have emerged from studies on the early development of the Drosophila melanogaster embryo. In the late 1980s, studies on Bicoid provided the first solid experimental evidence for the existence of morphogenetic gradients and their implication in axial patterning. Bicoid has since stimulated further research, bringing together developmental and cell biologists, physicists and theoreticians to address fundamental biological questions. These include mechanistic aspects of transcriptional and translational control, molecular and functional aspects of evolution and, more recently with the development of quantitative approaches, the robustness of axial patterning in a systems biology view. However, recent studies provide data which lead to contradictory interpretations. Here, we discuss these recent observations, highlighting the data helping to understand how anterior patterning is achieved under the control of Bicoid and point to novel challenges for future studies. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A genetic algorithm (GA) is a procedure that mimics processes occurring in Darwinian evolution to solve computational problems. A GA introduces variation through "mutation" and "recombination" in a "population" of possible solutions to a problem, encoded as strings of characters in "genomes," and allows this population to evolve, using selection procedures that favor the gradual enrichment of the gene pool with the genomes of the "fitter" individuals. GAs are particularly suitable for optimization problems in which an effective system design or set of parameter values is sought.In nature, genetic regulatory networks (GRNs) form the basic control layer in the regulation of gene expression levels. GRNs are composed of regulatory interactions between genes and their gene products, and are, inter alia, at the basis of the development of single fertilized cells into fully grown organisms. This paper describes how GAs may be applied to find functional regulatory schemes and parameter values for models that capture the fundamental GRN characteristics. The central ideas behind evolutionary computation and GRN modeling, and the considerations in GA design and use are discussed, and illustrated with an extended example. In this example, a GRN-like controller is sought for a developmental system based on Lewis Wolpert's French flag model for positional specification, in which cells in a growing embryo secrete and detect morphogens to attain a specific spatial pattern of cellular differentiation.},

abstract = {Morphogenetic fields are among the most fundamental concepts of embryology. However, they are also among the most ill-defined, since they consist of dynamic regulatory processes whose exact nature remains elu-sive. In order to achieve a more rigorous definition of a developmental field, Lewis Wolpert introduced the con-cept of positional information illustrated by his French Flag model. Here we argue that Wolpert's positional information—a static coordinate system defining a field— lacks essential properties of the original field concept. We show how data-driven mathematical modeling ap-proaches now enable us to study regulatory processes in a way that is qualitatively different from our previous level of understanding. As an example, we review our recent analysis of segmentation gene expression in the blas-toderm embryo of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Based on this analysis, we propose a revised French Flag, which incorporates the dynamic, feedback-driven nature of pattern formation in the Drosophila blastoderm. Introduction Over the last few decades, we have witnessed tremendous progress in the field of developmental genetics. A large number of genes involved in regulating developmental proces-ses have been cloned and analyzed at the molecular level by genetic and, more recently, genomic approaches. However, despite this wealth of genetic information, we still lack an integrative view of how genes affect development, and hence phenotypes of tissues, organs and whole organisms. In other words, we lack an integrative view of a morphogenetic field. (1)},

@article{Kanodia2012,
abstract = {The early Drosophila embryo is patterned by graded distributions of maternal transcription factors. Recent studies revealed that pattern formation by these graded signals depends on uniformly expressed transcriptional activators, such as Zelda. Removal of Zelda influences both the timing and the spatial expression domains for most of the genes controlled by maternal gradients. We demonstrate that some of these patterning defects, which range from temporal delay to loss of expression, can be rationalized with the use of a mathematical model based on cooperative binding of graded and uniform factors. This model makes a number of predictions, which we confirm experimentally by analyzing the expression of short gastrulation (sog), a gene that is controlled by a combination of the Dorsal morphogen gradient and Zelda. The proposed model suggests a general mechanism for the formation of nested gene expression domains, which is a hallmark of tissue patterning by morphogen gradients. According to this mechanism, the differential effects of a morphogen on its target genes can depend on their differential sensitivity to uniform factors. {\textcopyright} 2012 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {The blastoderm of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is unusually well suited for analysis of fundamental questions in animal development. One such question is how genes specify the positional information which determines the developmental pathways (fate) of cells at appropriate spatial locations. In this paper we propose a dynamical model of gene regulation which explicitly describes how positional information is used in the blastoderm. The model is applied to analyze important experimental findings on the dependence of cell fate on the concen- tration of the Bicoid morphogen. The model shows that positional information in the presumptive middle body is cooperatively determined by maternal products of the bicoid and hunchback genes.},

@article{Turing1952,
abstract = {It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns on Hydra and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be found in text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading. {\textcopyright} 1990 Society for Mathematical Biology.},

abstract = {Patterning during organogenesis is fundamentally realized through the interpretation of morphogen gradients by particular types of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). However, as quantitative studies have reported, spatial profiles of morphogen gradients include intra-embryo and inter-embryo variability, which could lead to errors in spatial recognition by cells and variations in patterning. By mathematically modeling the processes of generation and readout of spatial information - information encoding and decoding, by an analogy to computer communication - and maximizing the reproducibility of patterning against noise, the general designs of gradient profiles and their interpretation have been clarified. Furthermore, over the past few years, basic studies on patterning in more dynamic situations, that is, patterning in growing tissues with time-variant gradients, have been initiated. Here we provide an overview of patterning studies, pattern generating GRNs, concepts of information coding design for robust patterning, and patterning in growing tissues.},
